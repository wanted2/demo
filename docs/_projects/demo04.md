# The Face Recognition project
We demonstrate how a facial recognition app can be built using Tensorflow Lite and Android.

## Features

* **Face Recognition**: By utilizing latest facial recognition technology we build a Android app to demonstrate the authentication capabilities.

* **Face Mesh Reconstruction**: By estimating facial interest points, we reconstruct the mesh surface from a single view.

* **Multi-View Recognition**: By aggregating different perspectives, we strengthen the recognition power to reduce errors.

## Technology stack

* Face Recognition, Deep Learning
* Android/Java,
* Tensorflow Lite
