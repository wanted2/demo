# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

<div style="align: justify; justify-content: space-between;">
From the initial stages of learning, I have joined several contests and was awarded prizes in National Mathematics Olympiads.
After joining the university in Japan, I transferred my interest in numbers to information science and technology. 
Under the scope of undergraduate research, I developed an algorithm for accurate and efficient search for nearest neighbors in large-scale high-dimensional datasets. 
This development had applications in Image Processing and Computer Vision. 
Under the journey in the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology of the University of Tokyo, Japan, I extended my interests to Computer Vision with the help of Machine Learning, and later, Deep Learning. The outcome was an extensive learning mechanism for representations using Deep Learning architectures and normalization.
Recently, I have paid particular attention to behavioral pattern recognition using Deep Learning. 
This attention has led me to several developments with applicable outcomes with high accuracy and efficiency.
